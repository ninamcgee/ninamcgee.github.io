                <p>  In 1967 Uhlmans Ice Cream started. George Smith grew up in Westboro and was a friend of Howard Ullman, who owned the farm. Howard began Ullman’s Ice Cream in 1967 as a farm stand.  A few years later George converted the little farm stand into an ice cream stand. George ran Ullman’s Ice Cream until about 1987. At that point, his son Richard took over the management of Ullman’s Farms.

                    Back in the early days there were no yogurt or sugar-free ice cream flavors. There were about 30 flavors of hard ice cream.

                    Now, Ullman’s Ice Cream Stand serves soft-serve ice cream and fat-free soft and hard yogurt as well as at least 60 different flavors of hard ice cream.

                    Today, Ullman’s sells more than frozen ice cream and yogurt. We also have frozen lemonade and frozen lime rickets, old fashioned ice cream soda’s and floats, dairy free and allergy friendly options and hot dogs and chips at lunch. <br>
